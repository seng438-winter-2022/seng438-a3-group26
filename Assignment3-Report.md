# 1 - Introduction

This lab explores whitebox testing as well as coverage calculations and tools. Using the same base we used for blackbox testing, we will be able to explore the differences while also practicing JUnit4 and coverage calculations. Throughout the lab, we will also be exploring and comparing some differences between the coverage methods, meeting minimum coverage requirements, and data flow.

### DU Pair Coverage

The dupair coverage for the `constrain` method is 100%, as all pairs appear in the test cases.

# 3 - Testing Strategy for New Unit Tests

## DataUtilities

### clone
> Returns a clone of the specified array.

`clone` specifies that the argument is not permitted to be null and states that the returned value should be a clone of the passed object. Looking at the method code shows that the function copies the contents from one to the other without anything too complicated happenning.

To test this method, we will explore 
- null parameters
- even 2D array with a variety of double entries
- a jagged 2D array with a variety of double entries

### equal
>returns true if two 2D arrays are exactly equal, false otherwise

The following test cases were developed based on the documentation of the `equal` method and its source code.

- two fully equal arrays passed
- two arrays the same length but unequal members
- first array is null, second is fine
- second array is null, first is fine
- both arrays are null
- arrays are of unequal lengths

## Range

### equals
> Tests this object for equality with an arbitrary object.

Based on the provided method description and available code, the following test cases will cover all.
- equivalent null object
- equivalent Range object
- non-equivalent non-Range object
- non-equivalent Range object
- non-equivalent null object

### combineIgnoringNaN
> Returns a new range that spans both range1 and range2. This method has a special handling to ignore Double.NaN values.

Based on the documentation and visible code, these test cases were appropriate to build:
- null ranges with null return
- 2 cases with each range being null
- Range with Double.NaN value expecting null
- Range without Double.NaN value (covered by the 2 cases testing individueal null)

### expand
> Creates a new range by adding margins to an existing range.

From the source code and from the documentations, we have built the following test cases:
- no change to lower margin
- no change to upper margin
- negative margins
- null range (not permitted)

### expandToInclude
> Creates a new Range object that includes the passed value

Test cases were created based on the documentation of `expandToInclude` and its source code

- value is inside range
- value is outside lower bound
- value is outside upper bound
- base range is null
- value is NaN
- value is positive infinity
- value is negative infinity

### scale
> Creates a new Range object scaled by a positive factor

Test cases were created based on the documentation of `scale` and its source code

- scale by a positive factor
- scale by a negative factor
- base Range is null
- scale by NaN
- scale by negative infinity
- scale by positive infinity

### shift(Range, double)
> Creates a new Range object shifted by a delta without crossing 0

Test cases were created based on the documentation of `shift(Range, double)` and its source code

- shift by a small positive value
- shift by a large positive value
- shift by a small negative value
- shift by a large negative value
- base Range is null
- shift by negative infinity
- shift by positive infinity

The screenshots below show the coverage form white box testing and show the full class coverage.

# 6 - Pros and Cons of Coverage Tools Used and Metrics Reported

The coverage tool ultimately chosen by our team was EclEmma. Due to its ease of access within the eclipse environment and the 
instructions of this lab catered to this coverage tool, it was chosen as our group's tool. However, one drawback of this coverage 
tool is that condition coverage is not tracked by this tool, and thus our group replaced condition coverage with method coverage,
which is tracked by this coverage tool.

# 7 - Comparing Advantages and Disadvantages of Requirements-Based Test Generation and Coverage-Based Test Generation

# 8 - Teamwork Allocation

Team work divided evenly as follows:

- **Measuring control flow coverage** was done as a full team to familarize ourselves with the system, explore EclEmma and ensure we were all on the same page.
- **Manual coverage calculations** were divided into pair programming to allow groups to work efficiently and on their own schedule (since it is midterm season). Jared and Jordan worked on `calculateColumnTotal` while Amir and Liana worked on `constrain`.
- **Developing new test cases** were divided equally between all members to, once again, allow for schedule flexibility.

Once all work was done, the group came together once again to review eachother's work, build the report, and practice the demo.

# 9 - Difficulties, Challenges, and Lessons Learned

# 10 - Comments and Feedback

It would have been nice for the lab to have reminders or examples on the manual coverage but this did not prove to be overly inconvenient as it was just looked up in the class notes and adapted to the lab.
