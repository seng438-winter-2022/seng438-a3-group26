# 1 - Introduction
This lab explores whitebox testing as well as coverage calculations and tools. Using the same base we used for blackbox testing, we will be able to explore the differences while also practicing JUnit4 and coverage calculations. Throughout the lab, we will also be exploring and comparing some differences between the coverage methods, meeting minimum coverage requirements, and data flow.

## 5.2 - Whitebox Coverage
The screenshots below show the coverage form white box testing and show the full class coverage.

# 7 - Comparing Advantages and Disadvantages of Requirements-Based Test Generation and Coverage-Based Test Generation

# 8 - Teamwork Allocation
Team work divided evenly as follows:
- **Measuring control flow coverage** was done as a full team to familarize ourselves with the system, explore EclEmma and ensure we were all on the same page.
- **Manual coverage calculations** were divided into pair programming to allow groups to work efficiently and on their own schedule (since it is midterm season). Jared and Jordan worked on `calculateColumnTotal` while Amir and Liana worked on `constrain`.
- **Developing new test cases** were divided equally between all members to, once again, allow for schedule flexibility.

Once all work was done, the group came together once again to review eachother's work, build the report, and practice the demo. 

# 9 - Difficulties, Challenges, and Lessons Learned

# 10 - Comments and Feedback

It would have been nice for the lab to have reminders or examples on the manual coverage but this did not prove to be overly inconvenient as it was just looked up in the class notes and adapted to the lab.
